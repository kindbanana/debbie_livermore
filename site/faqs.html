                        </div>
                        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Counselling is all about how you are feeling and the
                            relationship between you and your counsellor. The session is confidential and having another
                            person in the room would disrupt that process. Understandably you may be nervous the first
                            time you come. Having a friend bring you along or pick you up might be a good idea but your
                            friend won’t be able to come into the session with you and we don’t have a waiting room so
                            they will have to wait in the car or in a local café. If you are very nervous about the
                            session please call me and I’ll see if there is anything I can do to help.</p>

                        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>As I offer person-centred therapy the number of sessions is
                            open ended and up to you. We will have regular reviews to see how things are going and keep
                            the therapy relevant to your needs. We can work towards an ending together in good time.</p>

                            and how often do I have them?
                        </div>
                        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>The sessions are 50 minutes long. If you arrive late, we cannot
                            make the time up at the end as the next person may be waiting so please arrive on time.
                            Sessions are usually once a week but if you want to see me more frequently we can discuss
                            that in your first session. Most of my clients leave at least a few days between sessions to
                            process the emotions that may have surfaced.</p>

                        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>I understand that sometimes life gets in the way and if you
                            have to cancel try to give me 24 hours notice, in which case no charges apply. Cancellation
                            later than 24 hours mean the fee is still due. If you are cancelling because of Covid 19
                            isolation I can offer the session online so please contact me to make those
                            arrangements.</p>

                            or the Samaritans on 116 123 free phone number. I do not offer emergency cover. Please

                            it is all on one level with plenty of space. If access is a problem please call me, I am
                            happy to meet you outside and help you with the steps. However, if steps are a barrier then
                            I may be able to arrange to meet elsewhere. Please contact me to discuss this.</p>
                            <p>There is plenty of free parking around the premises and a bus stop nearby.</p>

                        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Person Centred Counselling is sometimes also called client
                            centred counselling. It is a humanistic approach. This means that the sessions are
                            completely led by you as the client. I believe that you are the expert on your life so I
                            won’t offer advice, give you homework or tell you what I think you should do. I will work to
                            understand your experience from your perspective, I will offer non-judgemental support and
                            will hold you in positive regard while we work together to find a way forward. This helps
                            build a trustworthy relationship in which you can feel free and supported to disclose
                            whatever is troubling you. You have control over the content and the pace of our sessions
                            and I will be alongside you.</p>
