                            <p>I am a qualified, registered and insured Counsellor. I am constantly learning both from
                                my clients and from further training and professional development. I recently completed
                                a certificate for Online and Telephone Counselling to make sure I was able to support my
                                clients during lockdown. </p>
                            <p>I am always amazed at the power a counselling session can hold and the ability of my
                                clients to grow and change.</p>

                                <p>I use a humanistic approach, which means I won’t judge you or tell you what I think
                                    you should do. The sessions are yours to use how you like, we can sit together in
                                    silence if that is what you need or you can talk about the issues that are troubling
                                    you, in a quiet, calm and confidential space. </p>
                                <p>Sometimes you may not even be sure what those issues are but together we can find a
                                    way to cope with the challenges life brings and I will be by your side as we explore
                                    those challenges and your feelings about them.</p>

                                <p>I know how daunting it is to take the first step and reach out to a counsellor. It
                                    takes courage and strength and shows that you are ready to address the areas in your
                                    life that are causing you distress and unhappiness. We can look at these together at
                                    your own pace. </p>
                                <p>I believe that finding the right therapist is an important first step</p>

                                <p>I believe therapy works best when the relationship between counsellor and therapist
                                    is

                                <p>I offer an initial assessment session and then, provided we are both happy to
                                    proceed, we
                                    will agree to meet on a weekly basis. Usually this will be on the same day of the
                                    week,
                                    and

                                <p>Together we will discuss what you want to achieve from counselling. I offer

                                    change.</p>
