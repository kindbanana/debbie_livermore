                      <p>I am a qualified, registered and insured Counsellor. I am always amazed at the
                        power a counselling session can hold and the ability of my clients to grow and
                        change. </p>
                      <p>I will treat you honestly, with kindness and respect until you find the path forward. I
                          won’t judge you, try to fix you or pretend I know the answers, but I will value you, sit
                          with you in your grief, chaos, sadness or anxiety and together we might help you
                          move forward and face the future.</p>
                      <p>I am continually looking for ways to support my clients and have recently taken
                          further training in anxiety, issues with mental health and the menopause, gender
                          identity and creative counselling ideas. I also teach counselling skills as I know the
                          difference being listened to can make and want to support a new generation of
                          counsellors.</p>
                      <p>If you have any questions about the process give me a call I offer a free 20 minute
                          phone conversation so you can be assured that we are a good fit before we start.</p>

                        a certificate for Online and Telephone Counselling to make sure I was able to support my

                                    takes courage and strength and shows that you are ready to address the areas in your
                                    life that are causing you distress and unhappiness. We can look at these together at

                                <p>I believe therapy works best when the relationship between counsellor and therapist
                                    is
                                    strong
                                    and we trust each other.</p>
                                <p>I offer an initial assessment session and then, provided we are both happy to
                                    proceed, we
                                    will agree to meet on a weekly basis. Usually this will be on the same day of the
                                    week,
                                    and
                                    at the same time of day.</p>
                                <p>Together we will discuss what you want to achieve from counselling. I offer
                                    counselling
                                    for
                                    many issues including stress, relationships, family problems, depression & feeling
                                    low,
                                    addiction, coping with change or wanting to make a change, loss of meaning,
                                    sexuality,
                                    abuse, bereavement, anger issues, self esteem, confidence, weight loss and
                                    anxiety. </p>
                                    <p>I am also a trauma informed therapist and will take steps to make you feel  both physically and
                                    emotionally safe in your sessions. Together we can look at the effects of trauma on the brain and
                                    I will take steps to avoid retriggering you during the session. </p>

                                    <p>I offer the Rewind Technique. (Closure without disclosure) This is a comfortable and effective
                                      treatment that can greatly reduce, and even remove, traumatic or phobic symptoms quickly through
                                      relaxation and guided imagery, all without even having to talk about the details of the traumatic
                                      incident with me. You are in control of these sessions and if the technique is used. </p>
